# Clustering Customer behaviour and purchase pattern

This project analyzes customer transaction data to uncover hidden patterns in purchasing behavior. By applying unsupervised machine learning techniques primarily K-Means clustering we segment customers into distinct groups based on metrics like purchase frequency, monetary value, recency, and product preferences. The goal is to enable businesses to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize inventory or recommendations.

Designed with clarity and practicality in mind, this repository serves as a complete walkthrough from raw data to actionable insights ideal for students, analysts, and data science enthusiasts.
